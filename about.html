<p>I am a software engineer specialising in building and maintaining large, high availability server applications in Scala, Java and C++. I enjoy the challenge of building large software systems and defining architectures that best supports their business and technical requirements.</p>

<h2>Interests</h2>

<p>I enjoy learning new programming languages and paradimgs. Currently I am exploring functional programming with Scala. I am intrigued with the similarities and differences in object oriented and functional design.</p>

<p>Modern cloud architectures, especially no-sql databases and how they achieve high availability during failure. My interest in cloud computing and the technology that supports it was triggered while studying <a href="http://www.research.ibm.com/autonomic/research/papers/AC_Vision_Computer_Jan_2003.pdf">Autonomic Computing</a>.</p>

<h2>Specialties</h2>

<p>Designing, implementing and optimising robust multi-threaded, multi-process, multi-server software systems.

<p>Asynchronous server frameworks and integrating asynchronous and synchronous systems.

<p>Test driven development and getting legacy code bases under test. Refactoring and introducing Design Patterns. 

<h2>Other interests</h2>

<p>Outside of tech, I like to spend time with my family, run and practice Aikido.</p>

<p>I train with <a href="http://dublinaikido.com">Dublin Aikikai Aikido</a> in Dublin (also find them on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/DublinAikido">Facebook</a>).</p>
