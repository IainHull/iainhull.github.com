## About Me

I am a software engineer specialising in building and maintaining large, high availability server applications in Scala, Java and C++. I enjoy the challenge of building large software systems and defining architectures that best supports their business and technical requirements

## Interests

I enjoy learning new programming languages and paradimgs. Currently I am exploring functional programming with Scala. I am intrigued with the similarities and differences in object oriented and functional design

Modern cloud architectures, especially no-sql databases and how they achieve high availability during failure. My interest in cloud computing and the technology that supports it was triggered while studying [Autonomic Computing](http://www.research.ibm.com/autonomic/research/papers/AC_Vision_Computer_Jan_2003.pdf)

## Specialties

Designing, implementing and optimising robust multi-threaded, multi-process, multi-server software systems.

Asynchronous server frameworks and integrating asynchronous and synchronous systems.

Test driven development and getting legacy code bases under test. Refactoring and introducing Design Patterns. 

## Other interests

Outside of tech, I like to spend time with my family, run and practice Aikido

I train with [Dublin Aikikai Aikido](http://dublinaikido.com) in Dublin (also find them on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/DublinAikido)).
