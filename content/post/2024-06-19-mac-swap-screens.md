TIL you can swap your screens on your mac with some simple C code. I have two monitors at home and they seem to swap every time I connect them. I end up clicking in the settings to rearrange them.

Here is a small command line tool to swap your monitors [mac-swap-screens](https://github.com/IainHull/mac-swap-screens).
