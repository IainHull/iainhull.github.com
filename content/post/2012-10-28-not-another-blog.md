I could not get my work done these days without all the information people share on their blogs.  They answer my questions before I  think of them, keep me up to date with the latest tech news and stoke my imagination with new information and opinions.

The more I read and play the more I need some where to keep my notes, so I decided to stick them in this blog

## Github and Jekyll-Bootstrap

I wanted my blog to be as simple as possible and maintain full control over its content and where it is stored. I also wanted a blog with good support for code and easy links to where the code was stored. So hosting it on [github](http://github.com/) pages was an obvious choice.  I used [Jekyll-Bootstrap](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/) as probably the fastest way to get a blog up and running on github.

I followed the excellent [Quick Start](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/usage/jekyll-quick-start.html) and here I am.
